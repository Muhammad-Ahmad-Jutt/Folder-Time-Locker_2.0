This program works like a time lock folder which zip the file with a simple encrytion
What actually it does is 
        1.  ask the user for the date when the zip should be open and then encrypt the date 
        2.  the encryped code is the password of the zip which the user want to lock
        3.  When the specified time is reached the software automatically detects the date from the internet the again try to encrpy the date and use it as a passwod to uzip the zipfile it made 
        4.  if the date is the corrected date then it will unlock the zipfile if the date is passed then it will not unlock it 
        5.  another functionality software offer is add the unlock date to a file which is not protected py passwod rather can be seen without password
